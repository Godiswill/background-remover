## 💡 FAQ
### What image formats are supported?
We support common image formats including JPG, PNG, WEBP, and AVIF.

### Why is the first processing slow?
On the first run, the necessary data (~80MB) will be fetched and stored in the browser cache. Subsequent processing will be much faster.

### Is there an image size limit?
For optimal performance and browser stability, we recommend images under 10MB. Larger images may still work but could affect processing speed.
